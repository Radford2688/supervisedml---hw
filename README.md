After looking at the dataset I determined the logistic regression model would be preferable.  Once I scaled the data, the logistic regression became the better classifier with a higher accuracy score. I still do not believe the accuracy score suitable for standalone credit underwriting decisions and would want a larger dataset and further testing.
